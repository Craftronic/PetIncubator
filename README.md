Welcome to the **Pet Incubator** project repository. This open-source initiative is dedicated to the development and refinement of a DIY incubator suitable for a variety of small animals, including cats, dogs, and other mammals.

## Features:
- **Temperature Regulation**: Utilizes a PID thermostat for precise temperature control within +/- 0.1Â°C.
- **Humidity Control**: Features a PID humidistat to maintain optimal environmental conditions.
- **CO2 Monitoring**: Equipped with a CO2 meter to ensure a safe atmosphere for the animals.
- **Visibility**: Clear plexiglass design for easy monitoring.
- **Safety Alerts**: Automated alerts for any critical changes in environmental conditions.
- **Multi-Interface Control**: Manage settings via an on-device screen, web GUI, or Home Assistant integration.
- **WiFi Capability**: Includes ESP32 for WiFi connectivity and remote monitoring.

The repository includes detailed build instructions, firmware code (ESPHome-based), and a list of necessary components. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community are highly encouraged to enhance this project.
